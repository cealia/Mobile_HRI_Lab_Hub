**List the names and NetID for your partners here.**

This week's lab is a continuation of the previous week. We explore the role of both *siting*--the location and activity--in interaction, as well as the *form and appearance* of the robot in the interaction.


## Prep

### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors/Utility Knifes
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. **Found objects and materials** -- You will have to costume your CloneBot so that it fits in the intended setting. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative! We have fabric, just ask!
   




### Deliverables for this lab are: 

0. Fill in the questions along the way! 
1. 1 photo of costumed device
2. Reflections on the process
3. Video sketch of 1 prototyped interactions with costumed device
4. Submit the items above in the lab2 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report 
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Lab Overview
For this assignment, you are going to:

A) [Provide feedback to your peers](#part-a-provide-feedback)

B) [Site the interaction](#part-b-site-the-interaction)

C) [Costume the robot](#part-c-costume-the-robot)

D) [Wizard the robot](#part-d-wizard-the-robot) 

E) [Video record the interaction](#part-e-record)

Labs are due on Tuesdays before class. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Provide Feedback
You and your teammates will be assigned lab 1 submissions from one other group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear.

**Summarize feedback your feedback here.**

We really enjoyed how you utilized the robots to address our daily troubles. I thought it was funny and creative to get robots to fulfill our daily chores. One thing about the interactions I am worried about is the complexity of movements for your robot. Cooking, and grabbing various items seems to be a mechanically difficult task and I am excited to see how you will implement various mechanisms to achieve this!


## Part B. Site the interaction

Think about where the interaction you are prototyping is going to occur-- on a desk? on a floor? indoors? outdoors?

What other people and objects are in that space?

What activities are going on in that space? What activity is the robot going to be involved in?

\*\***Sketch and/or take photos of the site(s) you are considering.**\*\*

We design a robot cleaning machine in two situations:

(1) Indoors
 The robot cleaning machine clean the floor in the kitchen. We put the garbage in the garbage bag. The interaction will happen indoors on the floor to help people clean their houses. THe robot is going to clean trash in the trash can to prevent garbage.

(2) Outdoors

 The robot cleaning machine clean the floor outside. We put the garbage in the garbage bag. The interaction will happen outside ex: park. THe robot is going to clean trash in the trash can to prevent garbage.

\*\***Document the activities being considered.**\*\*


\*\***What issues or opportunties arise from the site and activities?**\*\*
In situation 1:

The use of sweeping robots in the kitchen presents both challenges and opportunities. We need to deal with spills and messes: Kitchen floors often get messy with spills and crumbs, which can clog the brushes of a sweeping robot or cause it to get stuck. Furthermore, kitchens often have a lot of furniture and appliances, making it difficult for sweeping robots to navigate and clean effectively.

In situation 2:

The use of sweeping robots in outdoor environments presents both challenges and opportunities. First of all you need to deal with rough terrain: Outdoor environments can be challenging for sweeping robots, with rough terrain, uneven surfaces, and obstacles like rocks and twigs. Furthermore Sweeping robots need to be weather-resistant to function effectively in outdoor environments, where they may be exposed to rain, snow, and other weather conditions.

## Part C. Costume the robot

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop one costume so that CloneBot can fit into it's setting.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? 

Pick one of the custumes and make it with paper or cardboard or any other material!

\*\***Include sketches of what your robot might look like here.**\*\*

\*\***Include photos of your custumed robot here.**\*\*

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the robot to look?**\*\*

We take into account the practicality and stability of the tool. We are worried that sweeping robots may not effectively clean all areas of a floor, especially in corners or under furniture, so we designed the broom to be very long to prevent these kinds of situation. Also sweeping robots may struggle to navigate around obstacles or may get stuck in tight spaces, so we make the design not too big for the robot.

## Part D. Wizard the Robot
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the robot while someone interacts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype.

## Part E. Record

\*\***Take videos of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*
Be generous in acknowledging their contributions! And also recognizing any other influences (e.g. from YouTube, Github, Twitter) that informed your design.

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*

Labs are due on Tuesdays before class. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.
